### User Stories

**User Sign Up:**
```
As a user of ACEBOOK
So I can post something in my name
I want to sign up.
```
**Planning:**

In routes.rb:
```
resources: users
```

-> button "Sign Up" on homepage which links to users/new page - index.html.erb

-> users/new will be a form containing: -
  - email address
  - username
  - password
  - Sign Me Up

-> save user in database: id, email, username, encrypted password (encrypted password assigned to validation ticket)

-> if save didn't work, redirect back to form with error messages (assigned to validation ticket)

-> else
  - user is logged in (sessions/new)
  - redirect to user's posts page
  - receive message to say successful sign up!

| Class | User |
----|----
| Properties | username, email, password |
| Methods | < ApplicationRecord |

User Table
id | username | email | password
-|-|-|-

To create user table, we did:
```
bin/rails generate model User username:string email:string password:string
bin/rails db:migrate
```
============================

**Further Research**

Linking Users to Posts:

class User < ActiveRecord
  has many: posts
end

class Post < A....
  belongs_to: user
end

===============================

**Reminders**

migration files for drop tables will need to be deleted once everyone (including Heroku) has run db:migrate

a line of code in the create posts method in the posts controller will need to be changed once we can store user details. At the moment a new user is created when a new post is created - obvs not ideal!
